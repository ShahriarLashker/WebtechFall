                    Hello! I am Md. Shahriar Laskher, a passionate computer science student at AIUB. 
                    I have a keen interest in web development, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. 
                    Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on various projects involving full-stack development, 
                    machine learning applications, and mobile app development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest technologies. 
                    My goal is to become a skilled software engineer and contribute to innovative solutions 
                    that can make a positive impact on society. In my free time, I enjoy coding personal projects, 
                    participating in hackathons, and reading tech blogs.
